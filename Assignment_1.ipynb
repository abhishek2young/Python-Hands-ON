    "* Python is a versatile and popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability.Here are some of the key features of Python >\n",
    "1. Easy to read Syntax : Python uses a clean and easily readable syntax , which makes it begineer friendly and reduces the cost of program maintenance.\n",
    "2. Dynamically typed : Python is dynamically typed , meaning you dont need to declare variables explicitly.Variables can hold values of any types , and their types can change during runtime.\n",
    "3. Interpreted language : Python is a interpreted language , which means that the code is executed line by line at runtime.This allows for faster development cycles and easier debugging.\n",
    "4. Large standard library : Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for various tasks file I/O , network communication , web development and more.This extensive library reduces the need of external dependencies and facilitates rapid development.\n",
    "5. Cross platform Compatibility : Python is a cross platform language which means that python can run on different operating systems , such as Windows and Linux systems without requiring to change the code.\n",
    "6. Object Oriented Programming(OOP Support) : Python support object oriented programming principles , allowing developers to define classes and create objects with encapsulated data and methods.This feature promotes code reusablity and modular design.\n",
    "7. Extensiblity and intergration : Python can easily integrate with other languages such as C , C++ , Java.This enables developers to leverage existing libraries and components written in other languages, making python a powerful programming language for integration tasks.\n",
    "8. Third party libraries : Python has a vast ecosystem of third party libraries and frameworks such as pandas , numpy , flask ,Django , tensorflow , and many more. These libraries extend the capabilities of Python and enable developers to tackle complex tasks efficiently.\n",
    "9. Rapid prototyping : Pythons simplicity and easy to use makes it best choice for rapid prototyping.It allows developers to test their ideas and concepts quickly before investing time and effort in implementation.\n",
    "10. Community and support : Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development ,create libraries and provide support through forums , online communities and extensive documentation.This Vibrant community ensures that python remains up to date and well supported.\n",
    "* These key features have contributed to pythons popularity and made it a preferable language for a wide range of applications including web development , data analysis , scientific computing ,artificial intelligence and more.\n"

    "* Python supports several built-in data types that allow you to store and manipulate different data types.Here are some of the most common data types that Python supports.\n",
    "1. Numeric data types : \n",
    "> int : Represents integer values e.g : 5 , -10 , 100\n",
    "> float : Represents floating point values (Real numbers with decimal points) e.g: 3.14 , -0.5 , 2.0\n",
    "2. String \n",
    "> str : Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes or double quotes or triple quotes e.g \"Hi there\"\n",
    "3. Boolean data types : \n",
    "> bool : Represents boolean values  , either true or false.Used for logical operations and control flow.\n",
    "4. Sequence data types : \n",
    "> list : Represents an ordered collection of elements.Mutable(Modifiable) and denoted by square brackets[].\n",
    "> tuple : Represents an ordered collection of elements.Immutable(cannot be modified once created) and denoted by parantheses().\n",
    "> range : Represents a sequence of numbers with a specified start , end and step size.Used in iterations.\n",
    "5. Mapping type :\n",
    "> dict : Represents a collection of key and value pairs.Mutable and denoted by curly brackets {} . With key value pairs seperated by colons :\n",
    "6. Set types : \n",
    "> set : Represents an unordered collection of unique values.Mutable and denoted by curly brackets {}.\n",
    "> frozenset : Represents an immutable set.Similar to set but its elements cannot be modified once created.\n",
    "7. None type : \n",
    "> None : Represents a absence of value or null value.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Local variables are declared and defined within a specific function or block of code.\n",
    "* They are only accessible within function or block in which they are defined.\n",
    "* Local variables have a limited scope and are created when the function or block is executed, and they cease to exist once the function or block is completed.\n",
    "* Local variables can have the same name as the global variable or variables in other functions without causing conflicts since they are distinct entities.\n",
    "2. Global variables :  \n",
    "* Global variables are declared outside of a function or block of code usually at the top level of a modeule or script.\n",
    "* They have a global scope meaning they can be accessed from any part of the code,including inside functions.\n",
    "* Global variables remain in memory throughout the execution of the program and retian their values unless modified.\n",
    "* When modifying a global variable inside a function , you need to use the \"global\" keyword to indicate that you want to reference the global variable rathe than create a new local variable with the same name.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "* In Python , you can write comments to provide explainations or add notes to your code.Comments are the line which are ignored by the python interpreter and serve as documentation for humans reading the code.There are two ways to write comments in Python.\n",
    "1. Single line comments :\n",
    "* To write a comment that spans a single line we can use the symbol \"#\" Everything after the # Symbol on the same line is consirded as a comment and is ignored by the python interpreter.\n",
    "2. Multi line comments : \n",
    "* Python doesnot have a built in syntax for multiline comments like some other programming languages.However you can use multi-line strings (enclosed in triple quotes) as a workaround to create multi line comments.Although these are not actual comments they are treated as strings and ignored by the python interpreter.\n",
    "> Comments are important in programming for the following reasons \n",
    "1. Code Documentation :\n",
    "* Comments help explain the purpose , functionality and logic of code to other developers (Including your future self).They provide additional context and make the code more understandable and maintainable.\n",
    "2. Code readiblity :\n",
    "* Well written comments improve the readiblity of code by breaking it down into logical sections and providing high level explainations.Clear and concise comments can make it easier for others to understand and work with your code.\n",
    "3. Debugging and trobleshooting :\n",
    "* Comments can be helpful when debugging code or troubleshooting issues. They can provide insights into the thought process behind the code, making it easier to identify and fix bugs or make improvements.\n",
    "4. Collaboration and Communicaton :\n",
    "* Comments facilatate collaboartion among team members working on the same codebase. They alow developers to communicate ideas, provide suggestions or share important information within the code itself.\n",
    "5. Code disabling : \n",
    "* Commenta are also useful for temporarily disabling specific line of codes during testing or debugging.By Commeting out code , you can exclude it from execution without deleting it , allowing you to isolate and analyze specific parts of the code.\n",
    "> In Summary comments paly a vital role in making code more understandable , maintainable and collaborative.By documenting your code effectively you contribute to the overall quality and long term viabiltiy of your software projects."

    "* eg : x = 10 \n",
    "2. Multiple assignment :\n",
    "* Python allows assigning multiple values to multiple variables simultaneously using a single line of code.\n",
